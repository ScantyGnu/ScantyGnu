ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Tadeo!

I'm a Freshman student at the University of Texas at El Paso pursuing a Computer Science degree. I am proficient in java, but i also have familiarity with C#, Python, and the Unity game engine. I have a basic understanding of web programming with tools such as: Flask, HTML and CSS. I have an interest in all things geeky so i hope one day i get to contribute to the development of a big project.

I'm a Freshman student at the University of Texas at El Paso pursuing a Computer Science degree. Iâ€™m currently learning to write in java and C# as well as how to implement my
current knowledge into the Unity game engine. I have an interest in all things geeky so i hope one day i get to contribute to the development of a big project.
